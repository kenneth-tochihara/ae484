\section{Changes Made}

    The team considered the changes suggested by Professor Gregory Elliott and modified the design of the aircraft accordingly. The primary changes made to the design are listed below. New engineering drawings are provided in the       of this document.
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The winglets in the previous design had a curved merge into the wing. However, this is difficult in terms of manufacturability. The blend is replaced by a hard corner between the wing and the winglet.
        \item For ease of manufacturing, the elevons are extended to the end of the wing rather than being in the middle
        \item A plywood plate is added between the two wings to provide support for all the components and the motor mount.
        \item The spars are reduced in length because the original lengths were too long
        \item Changes to the design of the motor mount
    \end{enumerate}
    
    Another suggestion that was made was not using a 3D printed motor mount due to potential shear between the layers of the 3D print making it a bad material choice. The alternative would be a metal (potentially Aluminum) motor mount. However, the team decided to continue to go with the 3D printed mount for weight benefits and faster prototyping. If through physical test the team comes to the conclusion that the 3D printed motor mount would not work, the switch to a metal motor mount would be made.
    
    The drawings for the final aircraft are appended at the end of this document.

\section{Manufacturing Files}
    
    The manfuacturing files for the laser cutter and 3D printers have been generated. They can be found \href{https://github.com/ktt3/ae484/tree/main/homeworks/homework6/manufacturing}{here} in our GitHub. The GCode for the 3D printers have already been generated for Max's CR6 printer.
    
    The final drawings for the laser cut, 3D print, and CNC foam parts are appended at the end of this document.
