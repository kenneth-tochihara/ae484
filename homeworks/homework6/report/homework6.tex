\section{Design Changes}

    The team considered the changes suggested by Professor Elliott and modified the design of the aircraft accordingly. The primary changes made to the design are listed below and the updated engineering drawings for the aircraft assembly are provided  \href{https://github.com/ktt3/ae484/tree/main/homeworks/homework6/drawing}{here} on our GitHub.
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The winglets in the previous design had a curved merge into the wing. However, this is difficult in terms of manufacturability. The blend is replaced by a hard corner between the wing and the winglet.
        \item For ease of manufacturing, the elevons are extended to the end of the wing rather than being in the middle
        \item A plywood plate is added between the two wings to provide support for all the components and the motor mount.
        \item The spars are reduced in length because the original lengths were too long
        \item Changes to the design of the motor mount
    \end{enumerate}
    
    Another suggestion that was made was to not use a 3D printed motor mount due to potential shear between the layers of the 3D print, making it a bad material choice. The alternative would be an aluminum motor mount. However, the team decided to continue with the 3D printed mount for weight benefits and faster prototyping. If experimental tests conclude that the 3D printed motor mount fails, the switch to a metal motor mount will be made.

\section{Bill of Materials}

    The bill of materials accounts for all components needed to manufacture the aircraft. When calculating the cost for the wings, it was assumed that each wing required one wing core and one balsa sheet to manufacture. Furthermore, the cost of the 3D prints were determined by the cost of the PLA material extruded to manufacture the component. The total cost of the aircraft based on this table is \$319.27.
